IMPORTANT:please enable hidden files

how to download and replace:

step1:Go to "C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\[folder below]"

step2:Replace this content folder with the content folder inside the zip file

step3:Have Fun!

what's inside:Replace old death sound(that sound is oof),replace old cursor pic,Some things are planned to be added (please tell us what you want to add in GitHub Issue)

Note: Updating the client will restore the sound etc. This is Roblox's problem, not mine. Never write in an issue that "the sound is back to normal after updating to the latest version".

Thank you.
